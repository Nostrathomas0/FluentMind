Busuu's nice interface taught me French to A2. There are deals, coupons and specials. Three years ago I had a monthlong trial. Half a year ago I bought a full year's subscription 
and did about a hundred 3-10 min lessons. I mixed it with other free website and resources I'd got out of the library. I also had many conversations with French speakers and I feel
confident as an Elementary French Speaker.
