Have you ever used a language text book? If your favorite part of the coursebook was the instructions, than Busuu's good for you. Busuu has some nice dialogues with audio files. There are 12 languages to learn, and decent demo. I used it for about 10 hours and was exposed to good words and dialogue but there's no real impetus to speak, which may be a good thing because I usually used it on my commute to work so at least I wasn't the guy on the bus speaking bad French.
Busuu teaches grammar well. It keeps points organized, and it's a good reference but it doesn't give too many opportunities to practice saying the words and phrases, which research shows is necessary for fluency. Presentation and app aesthetics give you a lot of clear questions like, "what do you say to ask someone your name?" here's a tip "Memorize the word(s) and listen to the example."
Busuu has good, clear audio, and the gap fill activities aren't too easy. Users can connect, among the 12 languages it offers. It's worth a try if you're trying to learn grammar. ****
