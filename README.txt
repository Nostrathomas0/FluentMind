This is Languapps, a network of discussion about language learning strategies. It's colorfully bare and we need developers and testimonials from people who are learning language. This is the business networking platform suited to teacher entrepreneurs in collaboration with other arts.

This is Phantom, a simple design built around a grid of large, colorful, semi-interactive
image tiles (of which you can have as many or as few as you like). Makes use of some
SVG and animation techniques I've been experimenting with on that other project of mine
you may have heard about (https://carrd.co), and includes a handy generic page for whatever.
