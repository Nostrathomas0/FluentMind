This is Languapps, a simple network built around a discussion of the language learning strategies. It's colorfully bare of review content at the moment. We need testimonials from people who are learning a language. This is the business networking platform suited to teacher entrepreneurs in collaboration with other arts.

This is Phantom, a simple design built around a grid of large, colorful, semi-interactive
image tiles (of which you can have as many or as few as you like). Makes use of some
SVG and animation techniques I've been experimenting with on that other project of mine
you may have heard about (https://carrd.co), and includes a handy generic page for whatever.
