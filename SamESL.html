							<h1>Duolingo Talks More than Listens</h1>
							
							<p><b>SamESL's Duolingo use,</b> one 3-5 lesson is 10-15 exp, so we're looking at hundreds of hours of practice, but is it worth it? 
							<img src="images/SamESL/s51.jpg" alt="Hundreds of Hours" height="300" width="250" align="bottom">	<i> 8/26/20 </i></p>
							
							<p>For writing and listening, Duolingo gives good language exposure. You will learn phrases and sentence structures. You will also hear native speakers using
							the language, giving you the correct pronunciation. It's very gamified with hearts as the main game currancy. You lose these for incorrect answers and will have to wait for them to renew, putting pressure
								on you to learn and perform well.</p> 
							<p>On the other hand there are no vocabulary lists or vocabulary centered areas on the app. The app is a bit too tough on pronunciation when doing speaking activities. Spelling 
							is also frustrating. It is good for beginners but can be tough to really develop into a true speaker, even if you master the entire program for a said language. While you can 
							understanding structures of a language, it doesn’t offer much besides translation and pronunciation. 
							<h2>How it works</h2>	
							<p><img src="images/SamESL/s21.png" alt="Duolingo Front page" width="150" align="right" height="500"> When you open Duolingo you will see the screen on the right. This is a 
							The yellow crowns show your level and I've these are at level 5. The ones with grey rings around them are still in progress and the yellow ones with fractures are 
							old lessons that were completed but need to be reviewed. The app by itself will almost always try to keep three “fractured lesson" available on the intro screen for review.<p/>
							<p>There are a lot of different ways that the app teaches you vocabulary. Some are through pictures, some through translation, and some through listening or speaking. 
							<img src="images/SamESL/s22.png" alt="typical question" align="left" width="150" height="300"> On the left is multiple choice with pictures, you just have to look at the 
							English words and get exposed to it.<p/> 
							<p>And this multiple choice uses sentence translations <img src="images/SamESL/s23.png" alt="Sentence Translation" align="right" width="150" height="300"> Sometimes they 
							are English to Russian (or whatever language you’re learning) other times they are Russian to English. If you click on the individual words, it will give you the 
							pronunciation and Russian pronunciation of the word. <img src="images/SamESL/s24.png" alt="Sentence Translation" align="left" width="150" height="300"><p/>
							<p>There are two kinds of listening activities. One where you listen and you just select the words. The other one you have to write the words from memory (eek). 
							For both types of listening activities there is a normal speed and a slow speed. <img src="images/SamESL/s25.png" alt="Sentence Translation" align="right" width="150" height="300">
							To hear the slow speed, click on the turtle.<p/> 
							<p>Here’s a look at the second type of listening activity. A bit more intimidating as you have to type it correctly. The app is pretty tough on spelling, if you get more than 
							one or two letters wrong then you will get it wrong.<img src="images/SamESL/s26.png" alt="Sentence Translation" align="right" width="150" height="300"><p/>
							<p>The last type of activity is the speaking activity. This one is pretty tough as well.<img src="images/SamESL/s27.png" alt="Sentence Translation" align="right" width="150" height="300">
							The app wants you to have perfect pronunciation. I rarely get these right and since it is so tough on your pronunciation, they can be impossible for some languages. For the reason of time, 
							and also not feeling depressed from rarely getting them right, I just skip them. To skip a listening or speaking activity you can click “Can’t speak now”/”I can’t listen now” and it will skip the activity. You won’t be punished for skipped activities in this way. </p>
