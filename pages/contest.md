**example**
If you're beyond elementary level in the language, of you don't like drag and drop, this app isn't for you. Otherwise you'll probably have fun with it. Its features supports a very neat and well designed word input device. You'll learn words by matching icon-like images with audio samples and writen words. I used it for Chinese, and you get to draw the characters on your touch screen. They overlay pictures of what they represent; fish, knife. It's really quite a fantastic way to learn beginner Chinese that unites phonological, visual and muscle memory.  

Drops uses spaced repetition sequencing to help with vocab but has neither speech recognition nor lengthy passages. It's far from comprehensive. It's basically a lite, fun word memorization aid. Ads are light and you won't run into walls on the free version for a few weeks of use unless you want to use it a lot. The first use restricts you to 5 minutes a day but as you play, you win additional time. The ads, are 10 hour wait time between 5 minute lessons, access to word bank. Lots of locked content is enticing.  

Download it now and suppliment a grammar + conversation practice + reading and wrting activies. Use it for a few minutes a day with steady concentration to boost your vocabulary and have fun on a pared down app for great vocab input. ***
