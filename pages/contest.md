**example**
If you're beyond elementary level in the language, of you don't like drag and drop, this app isn't for you. Otherwise you'll probably have fun with it. It features a neat, well-designed voice recognition app. You'll learn words by matching icon-like images with audio samples and writen words. I used it for Chinese, and you get to draw the characters on your touch screen. They overlay pictures of what they represent; fish, knife. It's really quite a fantastic way to learn beginner Chinese that unites phonological, visual and muscle memory.  

______ uses spaced repetition sequencing to help with vocab but has neither speech recognition nor lengthy passages. It's far from comprehensive. It's basically a fun word game. Ads are light and you won't run into walls on the free version unless you want to use it a lot. At first you only get 5 minutes a day but as you play, you win additional time which is nice because of 10 hour wait time. You get access to word bank which will be pretty poor unless you buy it.  

Download it now and suppliment a grammar + conversation practice + reading and wrting activies. Use it for a few minutes a day with steady concentration to boost your vocabulary and have fun on a pared down app for great vocab input. ***
